# gavina-dmit2008-lab-1
 Repo for my first DMIT2008 Assignment

Instructions:

1: use npm i throught the terminal of the main folder {ggavina-dmit2008-lab-1}
2: use npm run build
3: use npm run dev (for some reason npm run preview wouldn't want to load my JSON file at all, but through npm run dev it's fine?)

NOTE: The website only shows the HTML for some reason despite everything being linked properly,
 and I was unable to configure the site properly on Netlify, as well as Vercel. I tried finding a workaround this, but I know that through using a local host everything works and  displays the JSON data correctly.
